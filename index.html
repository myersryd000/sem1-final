        <p>The <strong>Cold War</strong> was a long-term rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, the capitalist Western Bloc and the communist Eastern Bloc. The <strong>Cold war</strong> began after World War Two began following the deterioration of relations between the Soviets and the Americans. This breakdown of relations was fueled by ideological differences and perceptions of the future, with primarily the United States and the United Kingdom wishing for a democratic Europe, whilst the Soviets sought a Europe under authoritarian communism, directly opposing eachother and splitting the world between the two Blocs.</p>

        <!--<a href="alliances.html">Main Page: The State of the World from 1945-1991</a>-->
        <p>Throughout the <strong>Cold War</strong>, two alliances were the prevalent participants of the conflict, the America-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. NATO was formed in 1949 with the purpose of halting Soviet expansion and preparing for a Soviet attack on Western Europe. The Soviets, who had already created many mutual assisance treaties, formally established the Warsaw Pact in 1955, which stood opposed to the American NATO.</p>

        <!--<a href="conflict.html">Main Page: The Conflicts and Proxy Wars of the <strong>Cold War</strong></a>-->
        <p>The first conflict of the <strong>Cold War</strong> which featured global intervention was the Korean War, lasting from 1947 to 1953. The next armed conflict featured in the <strong>Cold War</strong> is the Vietnam War, which ended up lasting from 1955 to 1975, primarily featuring America and the Soviet Union backing South and North Vietnam respectively.</p>

        <p>As the <strong>Cold War</strong> was approaching the end of its time, the Soviet economy had grown stagnant and earned a sharp fall in foreign currency due to the downward slide in oil prices in the 80s. As Mikhail Gorbaches became the General Secretary in 1985, he led the way to many reforms, though these also weakened the structure of the Union, leading to the final collapse of the state in 1991.</p>
