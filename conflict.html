    <h1 class="header">The Conflicts of the Cold War</h1>
    <p>Although the Cold War did not result in direct war between the United States and the Soviet Union, it led to numerous indirect conflicts known as proxy wars. In these conflicts, each superpower supported opposing sides to expand influence without risking nuclear war. Major examples include the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. These wars caused widespread destruction and loss of life, particularly in the countries where they were fought. Other confrontations, such as the Berlin Blockade and the Cuban Missile Crisis, brought the world close to direct conflict. The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 was especially dangerous, as it involved the potential use of nuclear weapons. These events highlighted the constant risk of escalation that defined the Cold War era.</p>
