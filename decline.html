    <h1 class="header">The Decline and End of the Cold War</h1>
    <p>By the 1980s, the Cold War began to decline due to economic problems within the Soviet Union and changing political attitudes. Maintaining military competition with the United States placed immense strain on the Soviet economy. When Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the USSR, he introduced reforms known as glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) to modernize the country and reduce Cold War tensions. These reforms, along with improved relations between the superpowers, led to reduced military confrontation. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 symbolized the collapse of communist control in Eastern Europe. In 1991, the Soviet Union officially dissolved, marking the end of the Cold War and the conclusion of nearly half a century of global rivalry.</p>
