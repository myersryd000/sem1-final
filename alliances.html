    <h1 class="header">The Alliances of the Cold War</h1>
    <p>To protect their interests and contain opposing influence, both superpowers formed military alliances. In 1949, the United States and its allies created NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization), committing members to mutual defense. In response, the Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955, uniting communist nations of Eastern Europe under Soviet leadership. These alliances solidified the division of Europe and increased the stakes of any regional conflict. Beyond Europe, alliances extended worldwide as nations aligned with either the U.S. or the USSR for military and economic support. Some countries chose not to align with either side, forming the Non-Aligned Movement. However, alliance commitments often turned local conflicts into international crises, heightening Cold War tensions.</p>
