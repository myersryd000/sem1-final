    <h1 class="header">The Origins of the Cold War</h1>
    <p>The Cold War began after World War II as tensions grew between the United States and the Soviet Union, former allies who now had opposing goals and ideologies. The United States promoted democracy and capitalism, while the Soviet Union supported communism and a single-party state. Each side feared the other’s system would spread globally, leading to deep mistrust. Disagreements over postwar reconstruction, especially in Europe, intensified these fears, particularly as the USSR established communist governments in Eastern Europe. These tensions were reinforced by key events such as the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences, which revealed differing visions for Europe’s future. Winston Churchill’s description of an “Iron Curtain” symbolized the growing divide between East and West. Although no direct large-scale fighting occurred between the two superpowers, their rivalry shaped global politics for decades.</p>
